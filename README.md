### Hi there ğŸ’®ğŸ’®ğŸ’®

Lang: <sup>Esp, Eng, Cat</sup>

Since a lot of you asked me for a repository, there I go one more time.


In this github you will find:
```
 - A REST vs gRPC project.

 - The kotlin repository for my storyTeller apk.
 
 - Some Excercises and unfinished projects :')
```

>But, as I am working in my ğŸ”°**java11 cert**ğŸ”°, that will be in a time from now.
