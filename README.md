### Hi there ğŸ’®ğŸ’®ğŸ’®

Lang: <sup>Esp, Eng, Cat</sup>

Since a lot of you asked me for a repository, there I go one more time.


In this github you will find:
```
 - A REST vs gRPC project.

 - The kotlin repository for my storyTeller apk.
 
 - Old Excercises and unfinished projects.
```

>But, as I am working in my ğŸ”°**java11 cert**ğŸ”°, that will be in a time from now.


You can check on me as well in linkedIn, here is my profile: [ğŸª©](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vancuaviz/)
